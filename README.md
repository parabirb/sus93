## writing sus93 modules
writing sus93 modules is easy as 1, 2, 3! sus93 takes all the trivia out of writing a windows 93 package. all you have to write for a sus93 module is the function that runs on execution. [here](https://github.com/parabirb/example-module) is an example of a sus93 module.

if you put your sus93 module in your own github repo, then create an issue on [the sus93 repo](https://github.com/parabirb/sus93-repo), you can actually get your package added to sus93!
